That's an excellent request! I will build upon the previous explanation and provide all the essential formulas and further details about the poles.

## Control Theory of Standard Second-Order Systems: The Full Picture

### I. Standard Form and Core Parameters

The foundation of the analysis is the **standard closed-loop transfer function** $G(s)$:

$$G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}$$

The two core parameters are:

1.  **Undamped Natural Frequency ($\omega_n$):** Determines the **speed** of the system response (rad/s).
2.  **Damping Ratio ($\zeta$):** Determines the **shape** of the system response (dimensionless).

***

### II. The Roots and The s-Plane (Poles)

The system's dynamic behavior is governed by its poles, which are the roots of the **characteristic equation** (the denominator set to zero).

$$s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2 = 0$$

The two poles, $s_{1, 2}$, are found using the quadratic formula:

$$s_{1, 2} = -\zeta\omega_n \pm \omega_n\sqrt{\zeta^2 - 1}$$

These roots are critical for stability:
* A system is **stable** if all poles lie in the **Left Half-Plane (LHP)**, meaning their real part is negative ($\text{Re}(s) < 0$). This occurs when **$\zeta > 0$**.
* A system is **marginally stable** if poles are on the imaginary axis ($\text{Re}(s) = 0$), where $\zeta = 0$.
* A system is **unstable** if any pole lies in the **Right Half-Plane (RHP)**, meaning their real part is positive ($\text{Re}(s) > 0$). This occurs when **$\zeta < 0$** (negative damping).

#### Negative and Positive Poles

The terms "negative poles" and "positive poles" refer to the sign of the **real part** of the pole:

| Pole Type | $\text{Re}(s)$ | $\zeta$ Value | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Negative Poles** | Negative | $\zeta > 0$ | **Stable** (Poles in LHP) |
| **Positive Poles** | Positive | $\zeta < 0$ | **Unstable** (Poles in RHP) |
| **Imaginary Poles**| Zero | $\zeta = 0$ | Marginally Stable (On $j\omega$-axis) |

***

### III. Transient Response Specifications (for Underdamped Systems)

The transient response (the initial behavior before settling) is defined by several key metrics, primarily relevant for the **underdamped case** ($0 < \zeta < 1$).

#### 1. Peak Time ($T_p$)
The time required to reach the first peak of the overshoot. This is a measure of the speed of response.

$$\text{Damped Natural Frequency: } \omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$$
$$\mathbf{T_p} = \frac{\pi}{\omega_d} = \frac{\pi}{\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}$$

#### 2. Percent Overshoot ($\%OS$ or $M_p$)
The amount the response overshoots the final steady-state value, expressed as a percentage. This is a measure of relative stability.

$$\mathbf{\%OS} = \frac{c(T_p) - c(\infty)}{c(\infty)} \times 100$$

$$\mathbf{\%OS} = 100 \cdot e^{-\frac{\zeta\pi}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}}$$

**Finding $\zeta$ from Overshoot:** This formula can be inverted to find the required damping ratio based on a desired overshoot:

$$\mathbf{\zeta} = \frac{|\ln(M_p)|}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + (\ln(M_p))^2}}$$
*Note: In this form, $M_p$ is the fractional overshoot (e.g., $10\%$ overshoot means $M_p = 0.1$).*

#### 3. Settling Time ($T_s$)
The time required for the response to settle within a certain percentage (usually $2\%$ or $5\%$) of the final steady-state value. This is a measure of system speed and stability.

$$\text{Decay Rate: } \sigma = \zeta\omega_n$$

| Criterion | Formula for Settling Time $\mathbf{T_s}$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2% Criterion** (More common) | $\mathbf{T_{s_{2\%}}} \approx \frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n} = \frac{4}{\sigma}$ |
| **5% Criterion** (Less conservative) | $\mathbf{T_{s_{5\%}}} \approx \frac{3}{\zeta\omega_n} = \frac{3}{\sigma}$ |

#### 4. Rise Time ($T_r$)
The time required for the response to rise from $10\%$ to $90\%$ of its final value (for overdamped/critically damped) or from $0\%$ to $100\%$ (for underdamped). There is no simple closed-form algebraic formula, but an approximation for $0.1 < \zeta < 1.0$ is often used:

$$\mathbf{T_r} \approx \frac{1.8}{\omega_n}$$

### IV. Damping Status and Pole Summary

The poles' relationship to $\zeta$ is a fundamental concept you must know:

| Damping Status | $\zeta$ Range | Pole Type | Poles $s_{1, 2}$ | Response Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Undamped** | $\zeta = 0$ | Imaginary | $\pm j\omega_n$ | Pure oscillation, never settles. |
| **Underdamped** | $0 < \zeta < 1$ | Complex Conjugate | $-\sigma \pm j\omega_d$ | Damped oscillation, decays to a final value. |
| **Critically Damped**| $\zeta = 1$ | Real & Equal | $-\omega_n, -\omega_n$ | Fastest non-oscillatory response. |
| **Overdamped** | $\zeta > 1$ | Real & Distinct | $-\sigma_a, -\sigma_b$ | Slow, non-oscillatory response. |
| **Unstable** | $\zeta < 0$ | Positive Real Part | $\sigma \pm j\omega$ | Oscillations or exponential growth. |



The poles in the LHP are arranged on a semi-circle of radius $\omega_n$. The angle $\theta$ a pole makes with the negative real axis is related to $\zeta$: $\mathbf{\zeta = \cos(\theta)}$. This geometrical relationship in the s-plane is crucial for designing controllers (Root Locus).


That's a comprehensive request\! I'll update the summary table, add common system examples, provide a formula summary, and generate the requested comparison graphs using a simulated Python output.

## I. Updated Damping Status and Pole Summary

The dynamic behavior of the second-order system is defined by its damping ratio ($\zeta$). Below is the updated summary including a common physical example for each case.

| Damping Status | $\zeta$ Range | Pole Type | Poles $s_{1, 2}$ | Response Description | Common Example System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Undamped** | $\zeta = 0$ | Imaginary | $\pm j\omega_n$ | Pure oscillation, never settles. | An ideal **mass-spring system** in a perfect vacuum (no friction). |
| **Underdamped** | $0 < \zeta < 1$ | Complex Conjugate | $-\sigma \pm j\omega_d$ | **Damped oscillation** (oscillates and settles). Fastest speed with acceptable overshoot. | A **shock absorber** on a car that is too soft. |
| **Critically Damped**| $\zeta = 1$ | Real & Equal | $-\omega_n, -\omega_n$ | Fastest non-oscillatory response. Ideal transition point. | A properly designed **door closer** that shuts quickly without slamming. |
| **Overdamped** | $\zeta > 1$ | Real & Distinct | $-\sigma_a, -\sigma_b$ | Slow, non-oscillatory response (lagging). Safe but sluggish. | A system with **excessive friction**, like a heavy bank vault door closing slowly. |
| **Unstable** | $\zeta < 0$ | Positive Real Part | $\sigma \pm j\omega$ | Oscillations or exponential growth. | A rocket balancing on its tail with an uncompensated control system. |

## II. Summary of Key Formulas for Underdamped Systems

These formulas link the system parameters ($\zeta, \omega_n$) to the time-domain performance specifications, typically for a **unit step input**.

| Specification | Parameter | Formula | Relation to Poles $s_{1, 2} = -\sigma \pm j\omega_d$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Damping Ratio** | $\zeta$ | $\zeta = \frac{|\ln(\%OS / 100)|}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + (\ln(\%OS / 100))^2}}$ (from Overshoot) | $\zeta = \cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the negative real axis. |
| **Decay Rate** | $\sigma$ | $\sigma = \zeta\omega_n$ | $\sigma = \text{Re}(s_{1, 2})$ (distance from $j\omega$-axis) |
| **Settling Time (2%)** | $T_{s_{2\%}}$ | $T_{s_{2\%}} \approx \frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n} = \frac{4}{\sigma}$ | Primarily determined by the **real part** of the pole. |
| **Peak Time** | $T_p$ | $T_p = \frac{\pi}{\omega_d} = \frac{\pi}{\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}$ | Primarily determined by the **imaginary part** of the pole. |
| **Percent Overshoot** | $\%OS$ | $\%OS = 100 \cdot e^{-\frac{\zeta\pi}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}}$ | Depends only on the **Damping Ratio** $\zeta$. |
| **Damped Frequency**| $\omega_d$ | $\omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$ | $\omega_d = |\text{Im}(s_{1, 2})|$ (distance from $\sigma$-axis) |

## III. Example System Response Graph

The following is a simulated Python output showing the unit step response for the four stable damping statuses with a fixed $\omega_n = 5 \text{ rad/s}$ for comparison.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.signal import step

# Define parameters (omega_n is fixed)
omega_n = 5.0 
t = np.linspace(0, 5, 500)

# Define damping ratios for each case
zetas = {
    'Undamped (ζ=0)': 0.0,
    'Underdamped (ζ=0.2)': 0.2,
    'Critically Damped (ζ=1)': 1.0,
    'Overdamped (ζ=2)': 2.0
}

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title('Unit Step Response Comparison (ωn = 5 rad/s)')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Output c(t)')
plt.axhline(1.0, color='black', linestyle='--', label='Final Value')

# Simulate and plot responses
for label, zeta in zetas.items():
    # Transfer function: wn^2 / (s^2 + 2*zeta*wn*s + wn^2)
    numerator = [omega_n**2]
    denominator = [1, 2*zeta*omega_n, omega_n**2]
    
    # Get the step response
    # The actual Python function call would be like: T, Y = control.step_response(control.TransferFunction(numerator, denominator), T=t)
    # We use a conceptual plot for the output here:
    
    # Placeholder for actual response calculation (Conceptual Plot)
    if zeta == 0:
        c_t = 1 - np.cos(omega_n * t)
    elif 0 < zeta < 1:
        wd = omega_n * np.sqrt(1 - zeta**2)
        phi = np.arctan(np.sqrt(1 - zeta**2) / zeta)
        c_t = 1 - (np.exp(-zeta * omega_n * t) / np.sqrt(1 - zeta**2)) * np.sin(wd * t + phi)
    elif zeta == 1:
        c_t = 1 - (1 + omega_n * t) * np.exp(-omega_n * t)
    else: # zeta > 1
        s1 = -zeta * omega_n + omega_n * np.sqrt(zeta**2 - 1)
        s2 = -zeta * omega_n - omega_n * np.sqrt(zeta**2 - 1)
        c_t = 1 - (s2 * np.exp(s1 * t) - s1 * np.exp(s2 * t)) / (s2 - s1)

    plt.plot(t, c_t, label=label)

plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Key Observations from the Graph:**

  * **Undamped ($\zeta=0$):** Oscillates indefinitely around the final value (1.0).
  * **Underdamped ($0 < \zeta < 1$):** Shows **overshoot** and oscillations that decay quickly.
  * **Critically Damped ($\zeta=1$):** Reaches the final value fastest **without overshoot**.
  * **Overdamped ($\zeta>1$):** Slowest response, approaches the final value asymptotically **without oscillation**.

## IV. Trajectory Graph (Phase Plane Analysis)

A **trajectory graph** (or **phase portrait**) plots the system's output variable ($c(t)$) versus its derivative ($\dot{c}(t)$ or velocity) on the phase plane. It shows the path a system takes from its initial state to its final state (equilibrium point).

In control theory, the stable equilibrium point is usually $(c, \dot{c}) = (1, 0)$ for a unit step input.

| Damping Status | Trajectory Graph Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Undamped ($\zeta=0$)** | The trajectory is an **ellipse or circle** centered on the equilibrium point. The system orbits the steady-state, never reaching it. |
| **Underdamped ($0 < \zeta < 1$)** | The trajectory is a **spiral** that converges inward toward the equilibrium point (a stable focus). The spiraling motion reflects the decaying oscillations. |
| **Critically Damped ($\zeta=1$)** | The trajectory is a **straight line or simple curve** that quickly moves directly to the equilibrium point (a stable node) without crossing the $c(t)$ axis multiple times. |
| **Overdamped ($\zeta > 1$)** | The trajectory is a **slow curve** that approaches the equilibrium point (a stable node) along the slower eigenvector, taking a longer time to reach the final value. |


This is a focused set of questions. I will update the formula table for $\zeta$ and $T_s$, detail the effect of $\zeta$ on specifications, and provide the conceptual trajectory graphs for comparison, integrating the information from your uploaded files where relevant.

## I. Summary of Key Formulas (Updated)

The core characteristic of the second-order system is its damping ratio, $\zeta$. Here are the key formulas relating system parameters to time-domain specifications, particularly for the **underdamped case** ($0 < \zeta < 1$).

| Specification | Parameter | Formula |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Damping Ratio** | $\zeta$ | $\mathbf{\zeta} = \frac{|\ln(M_p)|}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + (\ln(M_p))^2}}$ (from Fractional Overshoot $M_p$) |
| **Peak Time** | $T_p$ | $\mathbf{T_p} = \frac{\pi}{\omega_d} = \frac{\pi}{\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}$ |
| **Percent Overshoot** | $\%OS$ | $\mathbf{\%OS} = 100 \cdot e^{-\frac{\zeta\pi}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}}$ |
| **Settling Time (2% Criterion)** | $T_{s_{2\%}}$ | $\mathbf{T_{s_{2\%}}} \approx \frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n}$ |
| **Settling Time (5% Criterion)** | $T_{s_{5\%}}$ | $\mathbf{T_{s_{5\%}}} \approx \frac{3}{\zeta\omega_n}$ |
| **Damped Frequency** | $\omega_d$ | $\mathbf{\omega_d} = \omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$ |

***

## II. Effect of Damping Ratio ($\zeta$) on System Specifications

The damping ratio $\zeta$ is a primary design parameter, as it directly controls the stability margin and the character of the transient response.

| Specification | Relationship with $\zeta$ (Assuming $\omega_n$ is constant) | Impact of **Larger $\zeta$** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Percent Overshoot ($\%OS$)** | Exponentially decreases as $\zeta$ increases. | **Shorter overshoot.** For $\zeta \geq 1$, overshoot is zero. |
| **Settling Time ($T_s$)** | Inversely proportional to $\zeta$ (via $\sigma = \zeta\omega_n$). | **Shorter settling time** (faster decay of transients), up to $\zeta=1$. (Past $\zeta=1$, $T_s$ increases). |
| **Peak Time ($T_p$)** | Increases as $\zeta$ increases. | **Longer peak time** (slower to reach the first peak). |
| **Damped Frequency ($\omega_d$)** | Decreases as $\zeta$ increases. | **Lower oscillation frequency** (slower oscillations). |
| **Response Speed** (General) | A trade-off between $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$. | **Less oscillatory** but potentially **slower** if $\zeta \gg 1$. The fastest response is at $\zeta=1$. |

**Goal in Control Design:** For optimal performance, the goal is often to design for a $\zeta$ that is **close to the critical damping boundary** (e.g., $\zeta \approx 0.707$) to achieve a fast response with minimal overshoot (often $4\%$ to $5\%$).

## III. Trajectory Graphs (Phase Plane Comparison)

The trajectory graphs (or phase plane diagrams, plotting velocity $\dot{c}$ vs. position $c$) are an essential tool for visualizing the stability and transient behavior of second-order systems. The equilibrium point (final steady-state) for a step input is at $(\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{0})$.

### 1. Stable Cases ($\zeta \ge 0$)

| Damping Status | Trajectory Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Undamped ($\zeta=0$)** | **Center** (Stable Orbit). The trajectory is a closed loop (ellipse or circle) around the equilibrium point, indicating **sustained oscillations**. |
| **Underdamped ($0 < \zeta < 1$)** | **Stable Focus**. The trajectory is a **spiral** that winds inward, getting closer to the equilibrium point. The spiraling reflects the decaying sinusoidal response. |
| **Critically/Overdamped ($\zeta \ge 1$)**| **Stable Node**. The trajectory is a **smooth, non-oscillatory curve** that moves directly to the equilibrium point without spiraling. Critically damped is the fastest path; overdamped is a slower path. |


### 2. Unstable Case ($\zeta < 0$)

| Damping Status | Trajectory Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unstable ($\zeta < 0$)** | **Unstable Focus (or Node)**. The trajectory is an **outward spiral** (or curve) that moves away from the equilibrium point. This reflects a response with exponentially **increasing amplitude**, confirming instability. |
